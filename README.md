# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across
the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.
This project evaluates some of the ratings data in order to help the 
journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb sets up the database. The code has some 
requested modifications for the database before we can perform any 
queries or analysis for them.


The NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb includes specific questions answer, 
which will help find the locations we wish to visit and avoid.
